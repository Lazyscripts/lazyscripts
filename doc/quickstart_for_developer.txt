Quick Start For Developer
=========================

How To Setup Developement Enviorment
====================================

Thanks for your interesting in our project, to develop lazyscripts, 
you must install the following packages.

    1. Python Nose - the python test utils framwork.
    2. Git -  the stupid content tracker.
    3. GitPython - the python git binding library.
   
Python Setuptools Installation
===============================

python setuptools is also a good way to install python modules, in some
cases, it's a much better when the python modules you want to use is too 
new.

    root@host # apt-get install python-setuptools

Python Nose Installation
========================

For software quality issue, we wrote a lot of test cases which based on 
Python Nose Test Framwork to catch exceptions or errors we don't know 
after the codes is modified. It recommands that you writing test case 
before writing your codes.

then install python nose

    root@host # apt-get install python-nose

Git Installation
================

No matter that the lazsycrtips backend is based on git, or we use git to 
control our codes, you always play git as you are a lazyscripts developer
,so you have to know git.

installation in debian or ubuntu.

    root@host # apt-get install git-core

GitPytyhon Installation
=======================

so on, we also need a git python binding library, it's also eazy to 
install that useing python setuptools.

    root@host # eazy_install gitpython

Prepare Test Datas
==================

    user@host $ make init_devenv

Run Test Cases
==============

excute tests but no error output.

    user@host $ make test

excute tests and display error output.

    user@host $ make devtest

Fetch Scripts Repository To Local Machain.
========================================

    user@host $ make fetch

How to build a scripts list file
================================

type this command, and this means that creating a new scripts list file 
for the remote git repository whch has updated. 

now, the official repository is mantianed by billy.

$ ./lzs list build git://github.com/billy3321/lazyscripts_pool_debian_ubuntu.git

How to Make Lazyscripts Support a Distribution
==============================================

Lazyscripts now place distribution relative config in two place: bin/ and lazyscripts/distro/.

bin/ directory place 2 shell scripts file, startup.sh and install_required_packages.sh. 
startup.sh ia use to determine the OS platform in PLAT_NAME variables, and WIN_MGR variables as window manager.
The install_required_packages.sh will check if the required packages and GitPython modules install correctly. If
not, the script will install it.

lazyscripts/distro/ directory place 2 python modules which will import while in need. There has 2 modules, syscmds.py
and add_official_repos.py. syscmds.py is include the command which can run in system, such as network config, or
packages repository config. add_official_repos.py will run for replace packages repository as faster local mirror.

After all, add the name of your distribution into slzs and startup.sh. Lazyscripts will support your distribution fine.
