    """Script Data Object.

    Every script is a directory, here is a sample with file disriptions:

    script_dir/            - directory name which is also the script id.
        |- debian_def/     - settings for specific distributions (here Debian)
        |   |                it is possible to add several such directories
        |   |
        |   |- source.txt  - unofficial source definitions.
        |   |- install.txt - list of packages to install before the script
        |   |                is executed (Debian specific).
        |   |- remove.txt  - list of packages to remove before the script
        |                    is executed (Debian specific).
        |
        |- desc.ini        - script metadata and attributes
        |- options.ini     - options be supported by this script.
        |- script          - script file, the one that will be executed
