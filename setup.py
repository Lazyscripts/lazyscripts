Lazyscripts is just a stupid script distrubtion tool and quick-installer in linux, which aims to provide a easy way to setup your working enviroment for people who need to install a new distrubution such as Debian,Ubuntu, or who want to have much better experiences in linux.

The original idea is from LazyBuntu, made by PCman in Taiwan. we usually need the script to customize to get somthing better, but theses customization may very hard to end users who new to linux, even the experienced end users. so that is why the lazyscript project starts.
